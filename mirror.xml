        MIRROR
        Created by Sudospective
        The mirror plugin allows you to use ease and add methods
        that takes P1's mods and inverts them to P2's.

        USAGE
        Ease:
        mirror {beat, len, ease, percent, mod, mode = ease or nil}
        Add:
        mirror {beat, len, ease, percent, mod, mode = add}
        Set:
        mirror {beat, percent, mod, mode = set}

        Any mod, alias, and node is valid.

        TODO
        - Support for more than two players
        - Support for specific degree of mirror offset
        - Support for error handling
